            When Destiny gifted you to me on December 4th, 2024 at 10 40pm I remembered our old times and I never knew that was turning point of my life . During YLTP, I fell for you, but when you couldn’t say yes, I chose to love you silently. Then, fate brought you back, and your message changed everything. Now, you’re the best thing in my life, and I fall for you more every day. ❤️

          <p>
            During YLTP, being around you felt natural, and before I knew it, I had fallen—hard. When you asked if I had feelings, I was honest, even though you couldn’t say yes then. Still, I loved you silently, cherishing every moment from afar.

            But fate had other plans. Your unexpected message brought back everything I had buried, and this time, you weren’t just a dream—you were real. Day by day, I fell deeper, and on December 27th, 2024, at 2:07 AM, you finally said yes. Now, you are my greatest blessing, and my heart has always been yours
